Troubleshooting
------------
SAP BW, UNX or HANA as DataSources with a type of address data, which can then be mapped by Google’s geocoder API (e.g. Rheinauhafen 15, Cologne) or represent lat-long values right away. Alternatively you could also use my custom data source providing test data for a quick hands-on.

NetWeaver or BO sever platform to deploy the extensions for production purposes (local mode works out of the box)

Google API Key that you can get from Google’s API Console (please note that local mode works without a key). The key will be used for Google's geocoder (used by both components). If you stick to the lat-long only version you don't need a key.


Installation
------------
•	Download the ConVistaMapsExtension.zip ZIP file. You may do this by clicking the Download ZIP button. Please note that you will need to extract the container zip first before you can reach the ConVistaMapsExtension.zip
