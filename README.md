<b>Breaking News: New Components Hierarchy Selector and ConVista SDK Chat added to the repository.</b>

Troubleshooting
------------
Please note that Design Studio's background processing functionality in combination with hideLoadingState on one of the maps will result in strange marker update behavior. It seems like the DS framework doesn't update the extension's hooks correctly. You may, however use background processing without hiding loading state of the map just fine.


Installation
------------
•	Download the ConVistaMapsExtension.zip ZIP file. You may do this by clicking the Download ZIP button. Please note that you will need to extract the container zip first before you can reach the ConVistaMapsExtension.zip

•	Click Tools in Design Studio > install Extension to Design Studio…

•	Choose “archive” as installation source (navigate to ZIP file) in dialog

•	Accept license and restart Design Studio

•	Have fun using our extensions

Meet me at ConVista Infoday or our world renowned carnival (traditional German costume festival) event in Cologne to chat about our Design Studio and Dashboarding ideas :-)
